        <h3 class="p1">Outliers</h3>
            <p>Outliers explains why “the self-made man” is a myth and what truly lies behind the success of the best people in their field, which is often a series of lucky events, rare opportunities and other external factors, which are out of our control.</p>

        <h3 class="p1">Great by Choice</h3>
            <p>Great By Choice analyzes what makes the world's best companies thrive in even the most uncertain and chaotic times, by distilling nine years of research and great stories into three actionable principles. Jim Collins is not playing games</p>
   
        <h3 class="p1">Oliver Twist</h3>
          <p>The story centres on orphan Oliver Twist, born in a workhouse and sold into apprenticeship with an undertaker. After escaping, Oliver travels to London, where he meets the "Artful Dodger", a member of a gang of juvenile pickpockets led by the elderly criminal Fagin.</p>
    
        <h3 class="p1">Good to Great</h3>   
          <p>Good To Great examines what it takes for ordinary companies to become great and outperform their competitors by analyzing 28 companies over 30 years, who managed to make the transition or fell prey to their bad habits.</p>

        <h3>Future Leaders</h3>
          <p>This story of a young Kenyan man's misadventures is really funny. Reuben Ruoro (the main character) gets into ridiculous predicaments that make you cringe, and then he devises ingenious surprising solutions. There are poignant moments as well, and the characters are well drawn and mostly believable.</p>
